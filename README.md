# Type Script

- Writing Typescipt is the same as writing Javascript with some "extra documnetation"

- Typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or node code

- It is best to think of Typescript as being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding

The TypeScript type sustem

- Helps us catch errors during development
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
- Only active during development
- Doesn't provide any proformance optimization
  
> Typescript Code (JS with type annotations)  ➡  Typescript compiler  ➡  plain old JavaScript ➡  NodeJs Executes it

Type - Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has.

**Primitive Types**

- number
- boolean
- void
- undefined
- string
- sybol
- null
  
**Object Types**

- functions
- arrays
- classes
- objects

## why do we care about types?

- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze out code for errors

- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around out codebase
